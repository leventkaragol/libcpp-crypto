## Semantic Versioning

Versioning of the library is done using conventional semantic versioning. Accordingly,
in the versioning made as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**;

**PATCH:** Includes possible Bug&Fixes and improvements. You definitely want to get this.

**MINOR:** Additional functionality added via backwards compatibility. You probably want to
get this, it doesn't hurt.

**MAJOR:** Additional functionality that breaks backwards compatibility. You'll need to know
what's changed before you get it, and you'll probably have to make changes to your own code.
If I publish something like this, I will definitely add the changes required for migration
section to the documentation.

## Full function list

You can find the complete list of functions in the library below. All methods in this library are static methods.
You don't need to create an instance of the class to use them.

> [!TIP]
> All methods and parameters descriptions are also available within the code as comment for IDEs.

```cpp
static std::string encryptWithAES(const std::string& plaintext, const std::string& key);

static std::string decryptWithAES(const std::string& ciphertext, const std::string& key);
```
